Not anymore, this package provides some essential features of the arduino IDE.\n\n* Verify a sketch\n* Build a sketch\n* Upload a sketch\n* Serial Monitor\n* Error output when compiling\n* Files are clickable in build output --> cursor jumps to that line in that file\n\n## Installation\n`apm install arduino-upload`  \n(Requires atom 1.10 or later)\n\n## Available commands\n* `arduino-upload:verify` - Verifies the sketches (checking for error output), deletes all sources, though\n* `arduino-upload:build` - Builds the current sketch, the .hex, .elf and .eep are copied to the sketch directory\n* `arduino-upload:upload` - Uploads the current sketch to a connected arduino\n* `arduino-upload:serial-monitor` - Opens the serial monitor of a connected arduino\n\n## Screenshots\nVerifying a program:  \n![verify](https://github.com/Sorunome/arduino-upload/blob/master/screenshots/verify.gif?raw=true)\n\nSerial monitor:  \n![serial](https://github.com/Sorunome/arduino-upload/blob/master/screenshots/serial.gif?raw=true)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Sorunome/arduino-upload/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/Sorunome/arduino-upload#readme","_id":"arduino-upload@1.0.1","_shasum":"65f28b2ce0bec8a3f83351cbd8756de0048dbd0e","_resolved":"file:..\\d-116119-3436-r8b58a\\package.tgz","_from":"..\\d-116119-3436-r8b58a\\package.tgz"}
