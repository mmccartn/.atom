Brings word navigation in Atom closer to the style of Sublime Text and the underlying OS. Overrides Atom's default shortcuts for moving/selecting/deleting to beginning/end of word.\n\nOnly overrides Atom's default word navigation in file editors. Atom's default word navigation remains for other text inputs (e.g., find and replace, command palette).\n\n<!-- ![A screenshot of your package](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/69169/2290250/c35d867a-a017-11e3-86be-cd7c5bf3ff9b.gif) -->\n\n## Installation\n\n- APM: `apm install sublime-word-navigation`\n- Preferences: Open Atom, go to `Preferences > Install`, search for `sublime-word-navigation`, and install it\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/rosston/sublime-word-navigation-atom/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/rosston/sublime-word-navigation-atom#readme","_id":"sublime-word-navigation@0.1.2","_shasum":"29864c53cdb861e93b33925fe42223b609226e2c","_resolved":"file:..\\d-11613-9880-si31cj\\package.tgz","_from":"..\\d-11613-9880-si31cj\\package.tgz"}
