Word Jumper Deluxe
===========

Provides ability to jump into camelCase and UPPER_CASE words using:

* `ctrl-right` - to move cursor(s) right
* `ctrl-left` - to move cursor(s) left
* `shift-ctrl-left` - to move cursor(s) left with selection
* `shift-ctrl-right` - to move cursor(s) right with selection
* `ctrl-delete` - to delete next sub-word
* `ctrl-backspace` - to delete previous sub-word

Replace `ctrl` with `alt` if you are on OS X - just as native bindings.

This is an enhanced version of ajile's word-jumper package (https://github.com/ajile/word-jumper).
